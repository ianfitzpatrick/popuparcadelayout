# Popup Arcade Layout for Attract Mode

This is a custom layout for the Attract Mode mult-emulator launcher. It's designed specifically to be a front-end for a popup arcade, where you want to showcase a selection of games on one bigscreen tv.

It was adapted from the *Cools* layout for Attract Mode.

What you get is a sort of kiosk of games that you can scroll through using your game pad. Each entry includes:

- A full screen video trailer of the game
- A lower third with:
    + Game title
    + Game creator (company / person / whatever)
    + Game description
    + Number of total games + what entry you are viewing ("2/15")

[Here's how it looks!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwnzwPHY1yI)

It's assumed you are using a bigscreen TV. So 1080p reoslution is hardcoded into the layout.
